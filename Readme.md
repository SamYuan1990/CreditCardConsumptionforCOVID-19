# Credit Card Consumption for COVID-19

## Introduce:
For assessing the number of suspected patients, assisting the community to quarantine, reducing the number of confirmed patients, and stopping the spread of the pandemic, tracking the daily trajectory of confirmed patients and quarantining them can effectively keep down the spread of the pandemic from the root cause.

## Background:
As of April 3rd 2020, more than 200,000 COVID-19 infections had been diagnosed in U.S., and more than 130,000 deaths had occurred in Italy. For assessing the number of suspected patients, investigating the number of confirmed cases in the community, reducing the risk of infection, and stopping the spread of the pandemic, quarantine is the most cost-effective way to curb the spread at its root. Therefore, we need to know the contact history of confirmed patients and open the moving trajectory of confirmed patients to the public. This allows all residents to self-check whether they have ever had contact with the patient in order to take further measures.

## Workflow:
People use credit card at market, the trading info will shared with CDC on blockchian network.
When some one confirmed at hospital, the confirmed info will shared with CDC on blockchain network.
Among all CDC over world, we are able to build a data lake.
Using the data lake to form AI to help more people.
 
## How it works:
### Scheme implementation principle:
Based on the consumption habits of users in Europe and the United States, we provide a solution. Confirm residents' contact history through the credit card consumption records of offline stores. Make full use of big data resources of businesses, hospitals and CDCs. Through Artificial Intelligence technology, people can check whether they have contacted suspected patients with potential infection risk, so as to quickly take observation, detection, quarantine and treatment measures.

### Offline credit card consumption can record the behavior track
When consumers go to shopping malls, supermarkets, gas stations and other places for consumption, they need to use credit cards for payment. Meanwhile, the business transaction system can be used as a transaction recording system which can record the track of residents' outdoor behavior. The transaction record system includes the location, time, card number, user name and other information. Businesses can upload the consumption records of citizens in the last 3-5 days to the blockchain network. It can track and trace the activity trajectory of a patient (such as patient B) in the last N days.

### Enter the card number to check personal contact history
Since the merchants have uploaded the consumption records of the last 3-5 days to the blockchain network, residents can log in to the network and input the last four digits of their personal credit card number to know whether their outdoor trajectory in recent days intersects with the confirmed patients. For example, residents can know whether there are patients who have stayed in the same place with themselves at the same time, so as to further determine whether they have had contact history with patients.

### View the "epidemic distribution map" around the community
During the pandemic, residents log on to the network, through the visual data and charts we provide, to understand the real-time distribution information of patients in their own area, including the geographic location information of patients, the distance between patients and themselves, and the personal whereabouts of patients. Through the data system of businesses, hospitals and CDCs, it is convenient for citizens to query all contact histories with patient B within the last 3-5 days. In this way, the public can know whether they have ever been in the same situation with patient B at the same time, and also understand the risk of infection in a certain area.
If residents find out that they have ever had a relationship with patient B, and there is a history of contact, and some new coronavirus symptoms such as fever, cough, chest distress appear after self-test, so it is necessary to submit personal symptom information to the big data system through the network. Because the medical big data of businesses, hospitals and CDCs have been connected, when residents submit personal fever information, the data system can be updated in real time.

### Building patient big data base
The hospital can upload the information of "confirmed patient B" to the blockchain system. These patient data can be used as a big medical data source that canâ€™t be tampered with, especially now more than 2 million people have been diagnosed in the world, which is a huge basic data.

### Artificial intelligence can help make decision whether need to be detected
According to the past behavior trajectory of residents and the distribution of patients in the local community, the website will help residents to decide whether to detect, quarantine or go to the hospital for treatment through artificial intelligence technology.

### Solution roadmap:
We hope this project can contribute to MiPasa, WHO or together with other organization as sharing data for COVID-19 globally.
